      "text": "A famous conjecture of Tuza states that the minimum number of edges needed to cover all the triangles in a graph is at most twice the maximum number of edge-disjoint triangles. This conjecture was couched in a broader setting by Aharoni and Zerbib who proposed a hypergraph version of this conjecture, and also studied its implied fractional versions. We establish the fractional version of the Aharoni-Zerbib conjecture up to lower order terms. Specifically, we give a factor t / 2+O(sqrt(t log t)) approximation based on LP rounding for an algorithmic version of the hypergraph Tur√°n problem (AHTP). The objective in AHTP is to pick the smallest collection of (t-1)-sized subsets of vertices of an input t-uniform hypergraph such that every hyperedge contains one of these subsets."

      "text": "Aharoni and Zerbib also posed whether Tuza's conjecture and its hypergraph versions could follow from non-trivial duality gaps between vertex covers and matchings on hypergraphs that exclude certain sub-hypergraphs, for instance, a \"tent\" structure that cannot occur in the incidence of triangles and edges. We give a strong negative answer to this question, by exhibiting tent-free hypergraphs, and indeed F-free hypergraphs for any finite family F of excluded sub-hypergraphs, whose vertex covers must include almost all the vertices."

      "text": "The algorithmic questions arising in the above study can be phrased as instances of vertex cover on simple hypergraphs, whose hyperedges can pairwise share at most one vertex. We prove that the trivial factor t approximation for vertex cover is hard to improve for simple t-uniform hypergraphs. However, for set cover on simple n-vertex hypergraphs, the greedy algorithm achieves a factor (ln n) / 2, better than the optimal ln n factor for general hypergraphs."

      "text": "The generalized Tuza's conjecture concerns the relationship between tau and nu on the (t-1) blown-up hypergraphs. There have been some works in the literature on the gap between tau and nu on other structured class of hypergraphs. An outstanding result of this type is Aharoni's proof that tau(H) <= 2 nu(H) for all tripartite 3-uniform hypergraphs H. Aharoni and Zerbib asked if there is a structural explanation that unites the generalized Tuza's conjecture and the above result-for example, does the exclusion of a certain substructure in the hypergraph H imply better gaps between tau(H) and nu(H). A particular substructure they studied is the \"tent\" subhypergraph (Figure 1)."

If this is the case, it could give a common structural explanation of the existence of small vertex covers in 3-uniform hypergraphs."

      "text": "In this paper, we answer this question in the negative. We prove that that there are hypergraphs H on n vertices that exclude tents with tau(H) >=(1-o(1)) n. Since nu(H) <= n / 3 trivially, this shows that the ratio tau / nu can approach 3 on tent-free 3 -uniform hypergraphs, and the extension of Tuza's conjecture as raised in [AZ20] does not hold. More generally, one might ask if there is some collection of hypergraphs which are excluded from blown-up hypergraphs whose absence implies a non-trivial gap between tau and nu. In fact, we prove a stronger statement showing that there is no 3-uniform hypergraph family F (that is absent from blown-up hypergraphs) whose exclusion alone could imply Tuza's conjecture. Our result applies for larger uniformity t and the fractional version of Tuza's conjecture."
