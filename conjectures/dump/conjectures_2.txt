Here, for a t-uniform hypergraph H=(V, E), the (t-1)-blown-up hypergraph H'=H^(t-1) is a t-uniform hypergraph whose vertices are the set of all (t-1) sized subsets that are contained in at least one edge of H, and corresponding to every edge e in H, all the (t-1) sized subsets of e form an edge in H'.",
